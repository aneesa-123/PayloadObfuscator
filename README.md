# PayloadObfuscator
The Custom Payload Encoder &amp; Obfuscation Framework was developed to explore how offensive payloads can be transformed to evade basic static detection mechanisms. Modern defensive tools (AV, EDR, IPS) rely on pattern signatures and known attack markers. Attackers often use encoding and obfuscation techniques to modify payloads.
